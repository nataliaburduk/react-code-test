# Tymeshift - React code test
Welcome to Tymeshift's react code testÂ ðŸ§ª

## Task description:

In our real Tymeshift frontend application we have an "All locations" page where we display all the locations where company users are located. This task is designed to be a simple version of a real page we use and to give you a feeling of what your job will look like in Tymeshift. On the other hand we will be able to check how you handle a real requirement. This is the simplified "All locations" page:

Implement small react application that will display "All locations" page.
Clicking on a specific location should display a modal with all the properties of that single location. Modal should be closable.

Locations on main "All locations" page are displayed with a card showing some of the location properties.
Every location card should also contain a section "Views:", displaying the real number next to it. Default starting value is 0.
Every time the user clicks on a location to display its properties, number of views should increase by 1.

All data is read-only and can be retrieved from [this API endpoint](https://6033c4d8843b15001793194e.mockapi.io/api/locations).

All application pages and components should follow the [provided design](https://www.sketch.com/s/e1647b30-8066-43dc-bbf3-5b81d5a01bb2).

## Guidelines

* Solution should be written in React
* You can upload your solution to GitHub or send us a ZIP file with the solution via email (via reply in Breezy)
* We tried to create a task with a small scope but take all the time you need to feel comfortable with your solution and do it at your own pace

## What we're looking for

* Is it a clean solution that is easy to follow, respects all the specs and the design
* How you approach and structure the solution
* How complete and detailed is the solution
